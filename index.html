              <li><strong>Structure</strong> - Working to understand the scope and structure for governance operations, establish the right approach to understanding API operations across an organization, and be effective when working with many different teams, operating at different levels of maturity.</li>
              <li><strong>Design</strong> - Work to provide guidance regarding API design, and consider how to measure if it is being implemented by teams. Working from group level, or centralized API guidance, and working to refine regularly across teams as things change.</li>
              <li><strong>Testing</strong> - Work to provide guidance regarding API testing, and track on the results of testing from design to production, making sure the entire history of a service exists, and the overall health of the APIs is fully understood.</li>
              <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Work to provide guidance regarding API monitoring, and track on the results of testing from design to production, making sure the entire history of a service exists, and the overall availability of the APIs is fully understood--meeting all SLAs.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance</strong> - Work to provide guidance regarding API performance, and understand how well APIs perform from different regions and cloud platforms. Providing a clear picture on what levels of performance each API will be able to achieve as part of overall service level agreements.</li>
              <li><strong>Security</strong> - Work to provide guidance regarding API security, scanning the entire surface area of an API on a regular basis looking for vulnerabilities, and anything that might be exploited by bad actors.</li>
              <li><strong>Observability</strong> - Push for observability into all teams and the services that they operate, making sure every stop along an API lifecycle is accessible to the entire team, with an emphasis on automation, and streamlining how each system understood.</li>
              <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Ensuring that all APis are discoverable and able to be measured as part of overall governance. If it isn't known about it can't be monitored, tested, secured, and analyzed for the value it generates across an organization.</li>
              <li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Measuring as much as possibly regarding what is going on with API activity, and centrally aggregating it to be analyzed for how API operations can be improved upon. Making sure everything that is being measured is also being analyzed, otherwise it shouldn't be collected in the first place.</li>
