              <li><strong>Low Hanging Fruit</strong> - Understanding what resources are already on the public websites, and applications, by spidering existing domains looking for data assets that should be delivered as API resources.</li>
              <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Actively looking for web services and APIs that exist across an organization, industry, or any other defined landscape. Documenting, aggregating, and evolving what is available about each API, while also publishing back out and making available relevant teams.</li>

              <li><strong>Definition</strong> - Work to make ensure that all definitions are being aggregated as part of the process so that they can be evolved and moved forward into design, development and production--investing in all of the artifacts that will be needed down the road.</li>
              <li><strong>Dependencies</strong> - Defining any dependencies that are in play, and will play a role in operations. Auditing the stack behind any service as it is being discovered and documented as part of the overall effort.</li>
              <li><strong>Support</strong> - Ensure that all teams have support when it comes to questions about web service and API discovery, helping them intially, as well as along the way, making sure all their APIs are accounted for, and indexed as part of discovery efforts.</li>

              <li><strong>Definition</strong> - Using definitions as the center of the API design process, developing an OpenAPI contract for moving things through the design phase, iterating, evolving, and making sure the definitions drive the business goals behind each service.</li>
              <li><strong>Design</strong> - Considering the overall approach to design for all APIs, executing upon design patterns that are in use to consistently deliver services across teams. Leveraging a common set of patterns that can be used across services, beginning with REST, but also evetually allowing the leveraging of hypermedia, GraphQL, and other patterns when it comes to the deliver of services.</li>
              <li><strong>Versioning</strong> - Managing the definition of each API contract being defined as part of the API design stop for this area of the lifecycle, and having a coherent approach to laying out next steps.</li>
              <li><strong>Virtualization</strong> - Providing mocked, sandbox, and virtualized instances of APIs and other data for understanding what an API does, helping provide an instance of an API that reflects exactly how it should behave in a production environment.</li>
              <li><strong>Testing</strong> - Going beyond just testing, and making sure that a service is being tested at a granular level, using schema for validation, and making sure each service is doing exactly what it should, and nothing more.</li>
              <li><strong>Landing Page</strong> - Making sure that each individual service being designed has a landing page for acccessing it's documentation, and other elements during the design phase.</li>
              <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Ensuring that there is always comprehensive, up to date, and if possible interactive API documentation available for all APIs being designed, allowing all stakeholders to easily understand what an API is going to accomplish.</li>
              <li><strong>Support</strong> - Ensuring there is support channels available for an API, and stakeholders know who to contact when providing feedback and answering questions in real, or near real time, pushing forward the design process.</li>
              <li><strong>Communication</strong> - Making sure there is a communication strategy for moving an API through the design phase, and making sure stakeholders are engaged as part of the process, with regular updates about what is happening.</li>
              <li><strong>Road Map</strong> - Providing a list of what is being worked on with each service being designed, and pushed forward, providing a common list for everyone involved to work from.</li>
              <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Make sure all APIs are discoverable after they go through the design phase, ensuring each type of API definition is up to date, and catalogs are updated as part of the process.</li>
