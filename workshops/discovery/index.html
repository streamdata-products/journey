			<h2>Journey - Discovery</h2>
			<p>This is the current outline for the portion of our general API Journey workshops focused on understanding where your digital resources are is critical to maturing and evolving in how you do APIs. API discovery means many different things to different groups, but in the context of this journey, it is about knowing where your APIs are, and understanding what your organization is capable of doing. Having a coherent catalog of API definitions for ALL of your organizational services, as well as the technical, and business details behind them.</p>
							<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>Defining what the meaning and goals for API discovery are, acknowledging there are many different perspectives on what is API discovery, and what it involves to move the conversation around it forward.</p>
				<ol>
									<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>1) New APIs</strong> - Being able to find new APIs when needed.
					</li>
										<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>2) Application Development</strong> - Being able to discover and identify the right APIs to be using when building a specific application.
					</li>
										<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>3) Team Planning</strong> - For use as part of wider team planning, and being able to articulate what is in production, what is being developed, and what is currently being defined and designed as part of a single group.
					</li>
										<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>4) External</strong> - Being able to find APIs quickly, as well as provide self-service discovery of services by clients, partners, and other external actors.
					</li>
										<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>5) Developing An API</strong> - A team is looking to develop an API and they want to understand if one already exists, or maybe better understand existing patterns in use by production applications.
					</li>
										<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>6) Execution</strong> - Being able to find an API so that you can make a call to it in some code, or through a client application like Postman.
					</li>
										<li style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 15px;">
						<strong>7) Governance</strong> - Being able to quantify what APIs exist across any group, organization, domain, and the enterprise enterprise at any moment.
					</li>

				</ol>
				<p></p>
								<h3>Definitions</h3>
				<p>Work to ensure that all definitions are being aggregated as part of the process so that they can be evolved and moved forward into design, development and production--investing in all of the artifacts that will be needed down the road.</p>
